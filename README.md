A minimal FastAPI implementation in Python2 + Django without pydantic

# Why do you make this? Can't you just use FastAPI directly?
I'm a big fan of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). It's elegant and saves lots of doc maintaince & API sepc communication costs for me.

But FastAPI needs Python3 to run, some legacy projects I maintained are still using Python2 and built by  Django framework. It would take 2 migration steps (Python 2 to 3 and Django to FastAPI) for moving them onto FastAPI framework.

So I decided to build a minimal FastAPI implementation in Python2 + Django, that I could instantly get the benefits from FastAPI without too many migrations on my legacy projects.

# Who should use this?
People who like the way FastAPI works but 
* Are still on the long migration process from Python2 to Python3
* Or dont want to do full system rewrite from Django to FastAPI
* Or dont want to upgrade from Python2 to Python3

# Tell me what is working
* Auto OpenAPI document generation
* Auto Schema Validation
