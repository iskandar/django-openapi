# django-openapi
A minimal FastAPI implementation in Python2 + Django without pydantic

# Why do you make this?
I'm a big fan of [FastAPI]([https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)). It's elegant and saves lots of doc maintaince & API sepc communication costs for me.

But FastAPI needs Python3 to run, some legacy projects I maintained are still using Python2 and built by  Django framework. It would take 2 migration steps (Python 2 to 3 and Django to FastAPI) for moving them onto FastAPI framework.

So I decided to build a minimal FastAPI implementation in Python2 + Django.


# Who should use this?
People who like the way FastAPI working but 
* Are still migrating from Python2 to Python3
* Or dont want to upgrade from Python2 to Python3
* Or dont want to do full system migration from Django to FastAPI
